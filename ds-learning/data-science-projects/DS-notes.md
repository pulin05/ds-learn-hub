Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithmm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems.

1.Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem.                                                                            

    2.Process the data (data wrangling).                                                                           

    3.Explore the data (data visualization).                                                                            

    4.Perform in-depth analysis (machine learning, statistical models, algorithms).                                                                            

    5.Communicate results of the analysis.
